# Crowdsourced High-Definition Maps for Autonomous Vehicles

## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome! This project focuses on creating high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles (AVs) through community-driven data contributions. By combining cutting-edge technology and user input, we aim to make AV navigation safer, more reliable, and cost-effective.

## 🎯 Vision
The goal is to build a platform where users can:
- 📍 Upload location data from their vehicles.
- 🗺️ Contribute to real-time, high-precision maps.
- 🚘 Improve the safety and reliability of self-driving technology.

This initiative leverages crowdsourced data to tackle the challenge of maintaining accurate and affordable maps for autonomous vehicles.

## 🌟 Features

### 1️⃣ **Location Upload**
Users can upload their driving data directly to the platform, contributing to a database of real-world road conditions. Each upload enhances the quality and accuracy of high-definition maps, supporting safer AV navigation.

### 2️⃣ **Interactive Sidebar**
The left sidebar allows users to:
- 🔍 Filter data layers (e.g., traffic flow, road conditions).
- 🎛️ Customize their view and track submission history.
- 🖥️ Access an intuitive, user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

### 3️⃣ **Color-Coded Data Points**
The platform uses color coding to represent different types of data:
- 🚦 Accident locations.
- ⚠️ Traffic changes.
- 🛑 Road hazards.

This feature highlights critical areas at a glance, making it easy to identify trends and focus on important details.

### 4️⃣ **Map Layers**
The map supports multiple layers, such as:
- 🚗 Traffic flow.
- 🌧️ Road conditions and weather patterns.
- 🛠️ Real-time updates on accident hotspots or construction zones.

Users can toggle these layers on and off to stay informed while driving or contributing data.

## 🌍 Why It Matters
This project addresses the high cost of creating high-definition maps by harnessing the power of crowdsourcing. By uploading driving data and integrating real-time insights, we can improve road safety and advance autonomous vehicle technology.
